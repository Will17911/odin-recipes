# odin-recipes
My Current project is to build a basic recipe website.

This will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

I will be demonstrating the basic html skills I have learnt so far including: 
<ul>
    <li>Working with text</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>Links</li> 
    <li>Images</li>
</ul>
