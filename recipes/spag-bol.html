    <h3>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine!</h3>
    <p>The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours!</p>
    <p>Serve it over pasta, stuff into <em>jacket potatoes</em>, make an epic <em>Lasagna</em> or <em>Baked Spaghetti Pie!</em></p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.
        </li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.
        </li>
        <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Slow simmer option:</strong> really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)
        </li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.
